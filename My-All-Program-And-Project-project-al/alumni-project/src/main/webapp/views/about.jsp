	<p>The Alumni Management System is a simple HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,JSP,JPA,SpringBoot/MySQL project
		that helps a certain university/college/company school manages its alumni
		data. This project has 2 sides of users UI (user interface), which are
		the admin side/school management and the alumnus/alumna's side. The
		admin side can manage all the list of job posted, alumni list, events,
		forum topics, and the gallery. The alumni site can create an account
		(to be verified by admin), post a job opportunity, create a forum
		topic, and join to other forums, commit to participate in an upcoming
		event such as homecoming. Talking about the flow of the Alumni
		Management System, universities/colleges/company school alumni will register
		to the website and this process will need the verification of the
		school management in order to enlist the alumnus/alumna in the website
		user. After the admin will verify the user as an alumnus of the school
		the alumni user can begin to explore the features or functionalities
		of the system on their side which are the job opportunities posted by
		other alumni or admin, a list of upcoming events, joining to the forum
		with the other alumni. For the administrator side of the system, aside
		from verifying the account and list of alumni, the admin also will
		manage the gallery to be displayed on the website and the gallery may
		contain some images of the school events with a short description. The
		admin will create the about content of the school to be displayed also
		on the website, this feature helps the school management update the
		about content of the system easily even without the presence of a
		developer. The admin can also post a job opportunity and can overwrite
		or manage the posted job and forum topic of an alumnus/alumni if any
		instances may occur.</p>
